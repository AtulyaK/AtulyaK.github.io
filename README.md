This repository will demonstrate in projects I am working on in Github, and elsewhere. The link to the Github pages is: AtulyaK.github.io.

Current Updates Section

2/10/2022

  I am working on the words that are layered on top of the video in the back. I will also begin working on the gallery aspect for the pictures placed in the projects section. I     will also begin the sumarry section for each project or important activity. The research I plan on completing is researching how to do a nice timeline for each project or         important activity.
