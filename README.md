Current Updates Section
---------------------------------------------------------
2/10/2022
  Goals prior to session:
  I am working on the words that are layered on top of the video in the back. I will also begin working on the gallery aspect for the pictures placed in the projects section. I     will also begin the sumarry section for each project or important activity. The research I plan on completing is researching how to do a nice timeline for each project or         important activity.
  End of session: I was able to get the words over the video. However, the words are weirdly placed. I also found a better way to put the video then Youtube. I will probably use V   Vimeo or a platform as such to host the video. Then I will embed it that way. Then maybe the Youtube elements may not show up. I have outlined the plan for the gallery. I ahve     also consolidated the photos and videos for those sections. I have found some strong inspiration for the gallery. I will look at the Javascript used in the example. That is       because there is JQuery used. I may have to search every line until I understand what each is doing. 
  Goals for Next session: 
-   Place words better.
-   Understand the JQuery for the inspiration
-   make the barebones of the gallery
   Next Planned session: 2/11/2022
